"""Per-platform JWT cache + refresh.

A single ``TokenManager`` instance is owned by each :class:`mudraid.Agent`.
Its job:

  1. On request: return a non-expired JWT for the given ``platform_id``.
  2. Mint a fresh JWT via ``POST /api/v1/auth/token`` when there is no
     cached token, when the cached token is near expiry, or when
     :meth:`refresh` is invoked explicitly (used by the 401-retry path
     landing in M4.6).
  3. Hold the cache in process memory only — never log JWT contents,
     never persist them, never expose them through public attributes.

Locked design notes:

- The cache is a single dict + a single ``threading.Lock``. A per-key
  lock would let concurrent mints for *different* platforms proceed in
  parallel but adds complexity that v1 traffic doesn't justify.
- Expiry is tracked by the wall-clock timestamp returned implicitly by
  the backend (``expires_in`` seconds added to ``time.time()`` at mint).
  We do NOT decode the JWT — the SDK is intentionally JWT-blind so a
  future signature-algorithm change in MudraID doesn't require a SDK
  release.
- The refresh-skew (default 30 s) is a deliberate over-correction:
  it triggers a refresh *before* expiry so a long-running request will
  not race the 15-minute boundary. Clock skew between the SDK host and
  MudraID's signer also lives inside this margin.
