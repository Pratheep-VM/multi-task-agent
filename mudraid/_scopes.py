"""Requested-scope value object — the empty-scope-never-all invariant.

The heart of EP-120-US-04's first safety invariant lives here as *structure*,
not as a runtime check that a future refactor could forget:

    An omitted scope set requests the empty (minimal) set — never a wildcard.

``RequestedScopes`` can only ever hold a concrete, de-duplicated tuple of named
scope strings. There is **no** constructor, factory, flag, or sentinel that
expands "no scopes" into "all scopes" — that API simply does not exist, so no
amount of convenient client behaviour can broaden authority by omission. The
one way to obtain authority through the SDK is to *name* each scope; naming a
wildcard (``*``, ``all``, ``*:*`` …) is refused up front with
:class:`mudraid.MudraIDScopeError` rather than forwarded to the token endpoint.

On the wire an empty set becomes *no* ``scope`` form field at all (RFC 6749
makes ``scope`` optional). The V2 token endpoint treats an absent/empty scope as
a request for nothing — least privilege by construction — and refuses to expand
it to the client's full entitlement. The legacy ``/api/v1/auth/token`` profile,
by contrast, historically expanded an empty ``scopes`` list to the agent's full
permitted set; that behaviour stays reachable only through the explicitly-named
legacy profile and is out of scope for this value object.
