"""Consequence-safe request execution — the no-blind-replay invariant.

EP-120-US-04's second safety invariant: *a consequential call whose outcome is
unknown must not be blindly retried in a way that could duplicate a
side-effecting action.* This module classifies failures precisely so retries
happen only where they are provably safe:

  * **Pre-response failures** (the server never received the request — e.g. a
    connect timeout) are safe to retry for *any* method: the action never
    started.
  * **Idempotent methods** (``GET``/``HEAD``/``OPTIONS``/``PUT``/``DELETE``, per
    RFC 7231) are safe to retry even on an *ambiguous* failure: replaying them
    cannot duplicate an effect by definition.
  * **Ambiguous failures on a consequential method** (``POST``/``PATCH`` sent,
    but no response read — a read timeout, a mid-flight connection drop) are the
    dangerous case. Here the server may have fully processed the action, so the
    SDK does **not** retry. Instead it either
      - attaches a caller-supplied **idempotency key** the server deduplicates,
        making the replay safe, or
      - raises :class:`mudraid.MudraIDExecutionUnknownError` and hands the
        outcome-unknown decision back to the caller.

An *HTTP response* — even a 5xx — is a definite outcome and is always returned;
retrying on status codes is a separate policy the SDK intentionally leaves to
the caller. Only *transport* exceptions are classified here.
