"""V2 machine-authority auth — ``private_key_jwt`` against ``POST /oauth2/token``.

This is the EP-120-US-04 upgrade of how an agent obtains authority. Where the
legacy profile posts a plaintext ``secret`` to ``/api/v1/auth/token`` and lets an
empty ``scopes`` list expand to the agent's *full* permitted set, the V2 profile:

  * authenticates with a **``private_key_jwt`` client assertion** — a short-lived
    JWT the client signs with its own private key, so no long-lived shared secret
    ever crosses the wire (RFC 7523);
  * names an **explicit audience** (the assertion's ``aud`` — the token
    endpoint's own identifier, per doc 02 §8) and an explicit **resource**
    indicator (RFC 8707) the issued token is bound to;
  * requests **explicit scopes**, and — crucially — sends *no* ``scope`` field
    when none were named, so an omission is the empty (minimal) set and can never
    broaden to "everything" (see :mod:`mudraid._scopes`).

Signing is pluggable through :class:`AssertionSigner` so the SDK core carries no
crypto dependency: an integrator supplies a signer (the optional ``[v2]`` extra
ships :class:`PyJWTSigner`, and tests inject a fake). The manager itself is
JWT-blind about the *access* token it receives — it trusts the endpoint's
``expires_in`` and never decodes the token, mirroring the legacy TokenManager.

Secret-safety: the signed assertion and the issued access token are credentials.
They are never logged, never placed in an exception message, and never exposed
through a public attribute — only the endpoint URL and non-secret request
metadata appear in diagnostics.
